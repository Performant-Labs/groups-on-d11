# Agent guidance for this Drupal site

This codebase is a Composer-managed Drupal site. Local development uses `ddev`.

## Local environment (DDEV)

Run commands from the project root:

- Start or restart the local environment with `ddev start`, `ddev restart`, and `ddev stop`.
- Install PHP dependencies with `ddev composer install`.
- Open the site with `ddev launch`.
- Run Drush commands with `ddev drush <command>` such as `status`, `user:login`,  `cache:rebuild`, and `update:db`.

DDEV project config lives in `.ddev/config.yaml`. Use `.ddev/config.local.yaml` for machine-specific overrides.

## Common Drupal workflows

- Add a module with `ddev composer require drupal/<project>`, then  `ddev drush pm:enable --yes <module_machine_name>`, then `ddev drush cache:rebuild`.
- Apply database updates after code changes with `ddev drush update:db --yes`.
- Import repository configuration into the site with `ddev drush config:import --yes`.
- Export site configuration back to the repo with `ddev drush config:export --yes`.

## Guardrails

- Do not commit secrets or machine-local overrides such as `.env`, `settings.local.php`, or `.ddev/config.local.yaml`.
- Do not commit `vendor/` or uploaded files under `web/sites/*/files`.
- Do not edit Drupal core or contributed projects in place.
- Put custom code in `web/modules/custom` and `web/themes/custom`.

## Running host commands (Claude bridge)

When an agent needs to run something only the host shell can do — `ddev`, `drush`, `git`, `curl` against a local URL, headless Chrome against DDEV — use the **Claude bridge**: the operator runs `./scripts/claude-bridge.sh` in a dedicated terminal and the agent drops request scripts into `.claude-bridge/req-<id>.sh`. See [`claude-bridge.md`](./claude-bridge.md) for the full protocol, patterns, and security caveats.
